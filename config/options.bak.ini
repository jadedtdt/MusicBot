; DO NOT OPEN THIS FILE WITH NOTEPAD.  If you don't have a preferred text
; editor, use notepad++ or any other modern text editor.
;
; If you edit example_options.ini, Save-As options.ini
;
; This is the main configuration file for MusicBot.  You will need to edit
; this file when you setup the bot. The bot must be restarted for edits to
; take effect, but a reload command will be created in the future.
; Currently the bot does not overwrite any settings, but this may change in a
; future update.

; HOW TO GET VARIOUS IDS:
; http://i.imgur.com/GhKpBMQ.gif
; Enable developer mode (options, settings, appearance), right click the
; object you want the id of, and click Copy ID
; For roles you have to use the listids command.

[Credentials]
; Put your token here.  Not "secret".  The secret is not the token.
;Token = MjU0MDg5NTQ3NDQ3NTMzNTY5.CyJ-4A.mGYPKpaLuMW0MJlyMcMCNo4l1gw
Token =
; If you want to use a normal user account instead of a bot account, use these lines instead.
; Comment the token line and uncomment the Email/Password lines.
;Email = bot_discord@email
;Password = bot_discord_password

[Permissions]
; This option is for setting which user has full* permissions/control of the
; bot.  Only one user can be set here. Additional users can be granted
; permissions in permissions.ini, read that for more details.
;
; You can use this option two different ways:
;
;   1. If set to "auto", the bot will set the owner to the owner of the
;      application/bot account.  This can only be used with bot accounts.
;
;   2. To set the owner to another user, this should be set to the user's ID.
;      Getting a user's ID is explained above.
;
;      Example:
;         OwnerID = 998877665544332211
;
;      TLDR: enable developer mode in discord, right click a user's name in
;            discord, Copy ID, paste here.
;
; * The owner is not automatically granted dev command access (see below)
; 
OwnerID = auto

; This option is for developer use only.  Adding user ids here will allow the
; listed users to use commands marked as "Dev only".  These commands do not
; show up in the help command list, and include the "debug" command, which is
; used to run arbitrary code (very dangerous).  This should only be used when
; actively developing the bot.  Users with no interest in making changes to
; the bot's code should ignore this option completely. 
; 
; Note: The owner is NOT automatically added to this group.  These are special
; commands outside the scope of normal use.  Users must be explicitly added.
;
DevIDs = 181268300301336576 136665080820400128 127966571300651008

[Chat]
; Change this if you don't want commands to trigger another bot
; Example:
;	CommandPrefix = *
; This means the commands you use in chat are *play, *skip, etc.  This explanation exists because it seems no one knows what "prefix" means.
; You do not list commands here.  You do not put "CommandPrefix = *play *queue *np *skip *clear..." etc.  R e a d i n g   c o m p r e h e n s i o n.
CommandPrefix = ~

; Restrict the bot to only listen to certain text channels.  Uncomment (remove the ; at the start of the line) and add channel IDs to enable.
; An id looks like this number: 41771983423143930
; To get a channel id, enable Developer Mode in discord (settings, appearance), right click a channel, and click Copy ID.
; Example: BindToChannels = 41000000000000005 41000000000000007
; (Don't use these ids, they won't work)
; This next line is the one you uncomment to use the option:
;
BindToChannels = 302845211208318978
;

; Join a channel on startup.  Multiple channels can be added for multiple servers. Remember, use IDs, not names.
; If both this option and AutoSummon are enabled, this option takes priority.

[MusicBot]

; If no, delete videos after they've played, if the video
; isn't still in the queue, to avoid redownloading it.

; someone joins again.

; Automatically delete messages the bot sends after some time.

; when DeleteMessages is disabled.  Note the bot must have Manage Messages
; permission in the channel to delete messages from other users.

; down (for whatever reason), it will reload and resume the queue it had from
; when it was last running.

; Determines the verbosity of console output.  The default level is INFO,
; which is equivalent to what the output level was in previous versions.
; This does not affect the verbosity of logging in the log file, only to the
; console.  The available levels are, in order of least to most verbose:
;   CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
; In addition to the standard logging levels, the following levels are more
; verbose than DEBUG, and should probably only be used for debugging:
;   VOICEDEBUG, FFMPEG, NOISY, EVERYTHING
DebugLevel = DEBUG
